The map demonstrated in gifSource.py is functionally comparable to space-filling curves like the Hilbert curve in that it maps a path that theoretically covers every point in a higher-dimensional region–but doesn't actually qualify as a space-filling curve because it's neither continuous nor local.

Instead, it indexes rational pairs to single integers in order to achieve an infinite resolution, whereas a Hilbert curve takes a specified resolution to operate.

The software is set up to map only the first 51 integers, but something like 300-thousand are actually available–though I doubt they could be rendered with ease in python.
